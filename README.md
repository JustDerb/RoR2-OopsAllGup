# Oops! All Gup

Extends the number of times a Gup can split!

If you also have [Risk of Options](https://thunderstore.io/package/Rune580/Risk_Of_Options/), you can dynamically adjust the settings during your runs!

# Troubleshooting

**When a Gup dies, it doesn't spawn as many as I have configured in `SplitCount`**

This is due to protections in the Spawn Director so that the game doesn't spawn unlimited enemies and potentially crash your game. Currently this mod doesn't remove this limit.

# Changelog

### 1.0.1

* Update code to work with the new Risk of Rain 2 DLC: Seekers of the Storm
* Refactored code to remove IL injection (and use a regular hook instead). This should allow this mod to hopefully continue working after most game updates and be more friendly to other mods.
* Reduced log spam
* Fixed logging to now be filterable in the mod window

### 1.0.0

* Initial release
