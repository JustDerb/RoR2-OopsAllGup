# Oops! All Gup

Extends the number of times a Gup can split!

If you also have [Risk of Options](https://thunderstore.io/package/Rune580/Risk_Of_Options/), you can dynamically adjust the settings during your runs!

# Troubleshooting

**When a Gup dies, it doesn't spawn as many as I have configured in `SplitCount`**

This is due to protections in the Spawn Director so that the game doesn't spawn unlimited enemies and potentially crash your game. Currently this mod doesn't remove this limit.
